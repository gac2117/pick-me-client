# Pick Me!

This is a React application that I made for my React-Redux portfolio project along with a Rails API. I got the idea for this project through a friend who had a hard time picking restaurants to go eat at and wished there was an app that will do it for her. This application will allow the users to enter their favorite restaurants into the database and compile a list of restaurants. Then at a click of a button, one restaurant will be randomly chosen from the list and displayed on the screen. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation
1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. `cd` into the local repo you just cloned.
4. Run `npm install` while in the root directory.

## Usage
1. Make sure the `pick-me` Rails backend is set up and the Rails server is currently running.
2. Run `npm start` to start the React server.
3. Navigate to the address and port given on the command line in a browser.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions.

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/gac2117/pick-me-frontend. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

## License

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
